## 🧩 Advanced Automats
**A modular cellular automata playground with an ImGui-powered interface**

Advanced Automats is an interactive platform for running, exploring, and visualizing different types of cellular automata in real time.  

The project uses **Dear ImGui** for a flexible control interface, allowing you to switch rules, tweak simulation parameters, and experiment with various automata models.
